# SQLFluff BEGIN...END Block Handling Analysis

## Key Findings

### 1. Delimiter Handling in BEGIN...END Blocks

SQLFluff's T-SQL dialect handles BEGIN...END blocks with **optional delimiters** for statements inside the block. This is implemented through:

- `StatementAndDelimiterGrammar` which has `Ref("DelimiterGrammar", optional=True)`
- `OneOrMoreStatementsGrammar` uses `StatementAndDelimiterGrammar` for parsing multiple statements

### 2. BEGIN...END Block Structure

From `dialect_tsql.py`:
```python
class BeginEndSegment(BaseSegment):
    """A `BEGIN/END` block."""
    type = "begin_end_block"
    match_grammar = Sequence(
        "BEGIN",
        Ref("DelimiterGrammar", optional=True),
        Indent,
        Ref("OneOrMoreStatementsGrammar"),
        Dedent,
        "END",
    )
```

### 3. Test Cases Demonstrating No Semicolons

SQLFluff has explicit test cases showing statements without semicolons inside BEGIN...END:

#### Example 1: Simple SELECT without semicolon
```sql
BEGIN
SELECT '8'
END;
```

#### Example 2: Multiple statements with semicolons
```sql
BEGIN
    SELECT 'Weekend';
    select a from tbl1;
    select b from tbl2;
END;
```

#### Example 3: IF...ELSE with BEGIN...END blocks without semicolons
```sql
IF 1 <= (SELECT Weight from DimProduct WHERE ProductKey = 1)
    BEGIN
        SELECT ProductKey, EnglishDescription, Weight, 'This product is too heavy to ship and is only available for pickup.'
            AS ShippingStatus
        FROM DimProduct WHERE ProductKey = 1
    END
ELSE
    BEGIN
        SELECT ProductKey, EnglishDescription, Weight, 'This product is available for shipping or pickup.'
            AS ShippingStatus
        FROM DimProduct WHERE ProductKey = 1
    END
```

### 4. Key Implementation Details

1. **DelimiterGrammar**: Inherited from ANSI dialect as `Ref("SemicolonSegment")`
2. **StatementAndDelimiterGrammar**: Combines statement + optional delimiter
3. **OneOrMoreStatementsGrammar**: Uses `AnyNumberOf(Ref("StatementAndDelimiterGrammar"), min_times=1)`

This allows SQLFluff to parse both:
- Statements with semicolons
- Statements without semicolons (common in T-SQL BEGIN...END blocks)

### 5. Special Cases

- TRY...CATCH blocks also use the same pattern
- Atomic BEGIN...END blocks (for natively compiled stored procedures) follow the same structure
- Empty CATCH blocks are allowed: `BEGIN CATCH END CATCH;`

## Conclusion

SQLFluff explicitly supports statements without semicolons inside BEGIN...END blocks by making delimiters optional in the `StatementAndDelimiterGrammar`. This is a deliberate design choice to match T-SQL's flexibility where semicolons are optional in many contexts, especially inside control flow blocks.
