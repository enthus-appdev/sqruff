# T-SQL Join Hints Fix Summary

## Fix Applied
Removed the problematic override of `TsqlJoinTypeKeywordsGrammar` at line 9631 that was stripping out join hints support.

## Results
- **Before fix**: 4 unparsable files (97.48% success rate)
- **After fix**: 2 unparsable files (98.74% success rate)

## Fixed Files
1. `join_hints.yml` - Now correctly parses:
   - `INNER HASH JOIN`
   - `FULL OUTER MERGE JOIN`
   - `LEFT LOOP JOIN`

2. `nested_joins.yml` - Now correctly parses nested joins with hints:
   - `LEFT OUTER HASH JOIN` with `INNER MERGE JOIN`
   - `FULL OUTER LOOP JOIN`

## Remaining Unparsable Files
1. `function_no_return.yml` - Context-dependent lexing (architectural limitation)
2. `try_catch.yml` - Context-dependent lexing (architectural limitation)

## Code Change
```rust
// Removed this override that was breaking join hints:
// Override TsqlJoinTypeKeywordsGrammar to handle word tokens in procedure bodies
dialect.add([(
    "TsqlJoinTypeKeywordsGrammar".into(),
    one_of(vec_of_erased![...]) // This didn't include join hints!
    ...
)]);
```

The original definition at line 4471 already had proper join hints support, so removing the override restored the functionality.
